    Perform linear search to find the index of the target value in the list.
    
    Parameters:
        arr (list): The list to search through.
        x: The value to search for.
        
    Returns:
        int: The index of the target value if found, otherwise -1.

Sure, here's a simple Python program to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm:

python
Copy code
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Input two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Call the gcd function and print the result
result = gcd(num1, num2)
print("The GCD of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", result)
This program defines a function gcd that takes two parameters a and b and returns their GCD using Euclid's algorithm. Then, it takes input for two numbers, calls the gcd function with those numbers, and prints the result.

Certainly! Here's a Python program that performs linear search to find a value in a list:

python
Copy code
def linear_search(arr, x):
    """
    Perform linear search to find the index of the target value in the list.
    
    Parameters:
        arr (list): The list to search through.
        x: The value to search for.
        
    Returns:
        int: The index of the target value if found, otherwise -1.
    """
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [4, 2, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 9, 5]
target = int(input("Enter the value to search for: "))

index = linear_search(arr, target)

if index != -1:
    print(f"The value {target} is found at index {index}.")
else:
    print(f"The value {target} is not present in the list.")
This program defines a function linear_search which takes a list arr and a target value x. It iterates through the list and returns the index of the target value if found, otherwise -1. Then, it takes an input for the value to search for and calls the linear_search function, printing the result accordingly.

You can find the square root of a number in Python using the sqrt() function from the math module. Here's a simple program to find the square root of a number:

python
Copy code
import math

def find_square_root(num):
    """
    Find the square root of a given number.
    
    Parameters:
        num (float): The number whose square root is to be found.
        
    Returns:
        float: The square root of the given number.
    """
    return math.sqrt(num)

# Example usage:
number = float(input("Enter a number to find its square root: "))
square_root = find_square_root(number)
print(f"The square root of {number} is: {square_root}")
